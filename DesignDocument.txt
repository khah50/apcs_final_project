//reorganize later: photoshop 

1. Intro
Period: 2
Group members: Keith Hah, Caden Khuu
Group name: The Photo Shoppers
Project title: Pixeditor

2. Description
General description:
We are planning on creating a photoshop function
where you can modify an image by cropping it, changing its
saturation and contrast, sharpening it, blurring it, drawing 
on it, or rotating it. We will also be implementing multiple filters using kernel images.

Functionalities:
-Crop: cuts off certain parts of an image, depending on what your input values are
-Contrast: changes the sharpness of image
-Saturation: changes the intensity of the image's color
-Blur: blurs the image, which decreases its overall quality
-Draw: use your mouse to draw on the image (different colors/thickness)
-Rotate: rotates the image (ideally by intervals of 90 degrees)
-Sizing: Makes picture bigger or smaller

Libraries:
N/A

Additional:
-Add texts to describe what editing mode you're using

4. How it works
In order to use our project, the user has to use the mouse and keyboard to
change certain aspects of the image (ex: pressing R rotates the image, clicking the mouse to draw)
