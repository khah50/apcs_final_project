2. Description
General description:
We are planning on creating a photoshop function
where you can modify an image by cropping it, changing its
saturation and contrast, sharpening it, blurring it, drawing 
on it, rotating it, inverting it, and increasing or decreasing its size. We will also
be implementing multiple filters using kernel images.

Functionalities:
-Crop: cuts off certain parts of an image, depending on what your input values are. The image will be smaller.
-Contrast: changes the sharpness of image
-Saturation: changes the intensity of the image's color
-Blur: blurs the image, which decreases its overall quality
-Draw: use your mouse to draw on the image (different colors/thickness)
-Rotate: rotates the image (ideally by intervals of 90 degrees)
-Sizing: Makes picture bigger or smaller (just change the size of the image).
-Invert: Flips images

Libraries:
Some kind of GUI library (G4P?) so the user can input the name of their image.
(http://www.lagers.org.uk/g4p/). We also need this to properly edit the image using things like sliders.

Additional:
-Add texts to show user what editing mode they're using
-Get user inputted image
-(Maybe not necesasry) Provide sample images if user doesn't want to use their own images.

4. How it works
In order to use our project, the user has to use the mouse and keyboard to
change certain aspects of the image (ex: pressing R rotates the image, clicking the mouse to draw).
They may also run the code with differnet parameters to change certain aspects of the image (such as its size).

5. Functionalities/Issues

Current functionalities:
-Takes in user inputted images
-Resize image function with functional sliders.
-Draw function with variable color and size.
-Image filters using kernels.
-Displays current editing mode
-Crop function using built in functions to get part of the image.
-Custom brushes for drawing (e.g. marker, paintbrush, square, oval, etc...)
-Interface where the user can select which tool to use and the properties for each tool using G4P library.
-Multiple blur filters (Gaussian, radial, shape blur).
-Invert image
-Rotate image

Issues:
Sometimes getting a null pointer error. Also, we orignally had issues with libraries as we are using G4P, where we were unable to take values from a slider input. However, after looking over the documentation and the built in functions, we were able to figure it out. We are now using multiple G4P tools in order to adjust the usage of our editing tools.

//FINAL VERSION - NOT YET
